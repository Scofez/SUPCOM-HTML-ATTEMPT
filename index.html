              <h2>I - It's yummy!</h2>
              <p>Taste preferences are present when we''re born, with even babies showing a fondness for sweetness and fats. Over time, we develop a palate for other flavors. Some studies have suggested that children who are exposed to a wide variety of foods early in life are more likely to enjoy a greater variety of flavors as adults.</p>

              <h2>Too many choices</h2>
              <p>Variety means that we choose to eat a mixture of foods across the range of food types (cereal, fruit, dairy) and a mixture from within food types (rye, barley, wheat). Nutrients have been thought to be the basis of good health and have formed the basis of what has become known as 'nutrient based' nutrition.</p>

              <h2>It strenghtens my friendships</h2>
              <p>There really is a reason that humans have been sharing communal meals together since time immemorial. When we eat together, our so called ‘animal brains’ receive the message that we are safe and happy, and our bodies are flooded with positive hormones and emotions.</p>

              <h2>It makes me happy!</h2>
              <p>Dopamine is our reward center within our brain. It is the chemical that is released when we do something that makes us feel good. It is also the neurotransmitter that is responsible for hunger and sensation cues.</p>
