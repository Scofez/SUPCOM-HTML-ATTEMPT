Usually featuring a blend of vibrant ingredients like tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and plenty of pepper varieties, you'll have a hard time ever going back to jarred salsa after the first bite. Whip up a batch for your next Taco Tuesday, or keep a bowl handy for snacking with chips during a movie marathon. "
